In this project, I will be learning about the following:

Array:
Arrays are ordered collections of items that I can manipulate by adding, removing, or modifying elements. I will learn how to access elements by index and use various methods to interact with arrays.

Typed Array:
Typed arrays are specialized arrays for handling binary data more efficiently. I will learn about different types of typed arrays, such as Int8Array, Uint8Array, and Float32Array, and understand how they differ from regular arrays.

Set Data Structure:
A Set is a collection of unique values. I will learn how to use Sets to store distinct values and understand their properties, such as their inability to contain duplicates and their unordered nature.

Map Data Structure:
A Map is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys are unique. I will learn how to use Maps to store data and understand how they differ from plain JavaScript objects, particularly in terms of key types and order preservation.

WeakMap:
A WeakMap is similar to a Map, but with weak references to its keys. This means that keys can be garbage collected if there are no other references to them. I will learn how to use WeakMaps and understand their applications in situations that involve managing memory more efficiently.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, I will be able to:

Use map(), filter(), and reduce() on Arrays:
I will learn how to use these higher-order functions to manipulate and transform arrays:

map(): Create a new array by applying a function to each element of an array.
filter(): Create a new array containing only the elements that meet a specific condition.
reduce(): Reduce an array to a single value by applying a function cumulatively to its elements.
Understand Typed Arrays:
I will gain an understanding of when and how to use typed arrays, especially in contexts that involve handling raw binary data.

Understand Set, Map, and WeakMap Data Structures:
I will learn the differences between Sets, Maps, and WeakMaps, and understand their specific use cases and advantages in various scenarios.
