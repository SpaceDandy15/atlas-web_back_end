ES6 JavaScript Project

Overview

In this project, I learned about ES6 (ECMAScript 6) features and Software Linter concepts. I explored constants, block-scoped variables, arrow functions, default parameters, rest/spread operators, string templating, object properties, and iterators. These concepts helped me write more efficient and readable JavaScript code.

Key Learnings

Constants & Variables: I understood the difference between const, let, and var and how block scoping works.

Arrow Functions: I learned how arrow functions provide a concise syntax and lexically bind this.

Default Parameters: I saw how function parameters can have default values.

Rest & Spread Operators: I used ... to handle function arguments and expand arrays/objects.

String Templating: I practiced using template literals to embed expressions inside strings.

Object Properties: I learned how ES6 simplifies object creation and manipulation.

Iterators & For-Of Loops: I explored iterators and how to loop over iterable objects efficiently.
